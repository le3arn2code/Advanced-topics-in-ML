Imagine your computer has a small table (RAM). 
When you try to place a huge box (Docker image) directly on it, there’s no space left — the table breaks.

To fix it, we first store the box temporarily on the floor (disk) and then move it slowly to the smaller table (Minikube). 
That’s what this lab does — it teaches Minikube to handle big images without crashing the system.
