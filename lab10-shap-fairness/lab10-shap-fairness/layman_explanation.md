# Layman Explanation

We trained a simple model to guess if someone earns >$50K.
SHAP tells us *why* the model guessed that: which inputs pushed the decision up or down.
We then checked if the model treats different sexes similarly.
If not, we flag it with easy-to-read metrics and plots saved to images.
