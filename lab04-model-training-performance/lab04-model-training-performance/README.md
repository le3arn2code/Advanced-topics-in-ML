# Lab 04 â€“ Model Training Performance Analysis

This lab compares model training performance for small, medium, and large models using TensorFlow on CPU.

## Objectives
- Understand model scaling and its performance impact
- Measure CPU training time and performance bottlenecks
- Learn optimization strategies for limited environments

## Steps
1. Train small, medium, and large models
2. Measure time and system usage
3. Compare results with screenshots
4. Discuss scaling behavior

## Included Files
- train_small.py
- train_medium.py
- train_large.py
- screenshots (model visualization)
- troubleshooting.md
- interview_qna.md
- layman_explanation.md
